# This makefile demonstrates a static link to SDl2.
# use sdl2-config â€”-static-libs to get the extra libraries.
# however, do not use -lSDL2 as the link, because that becomes dynamic, and makes it a nightmare to distribute.
# Instead, simply place libSDl2.a into the directory, or setup a directory path.
