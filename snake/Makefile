# This makefile demonstrates a static link to SDl2.
# use sdl2-config â€”-static-libs to get the extra libraries.
# however, do not use -lSDL2 as the link, because that becomes dynamic.
# instead, simply place libSDl2.a into the directory, or setup a directory path.
# For dev purposes, it may be interesting to NOT have the libraries installed!
# Instead, setup all your libraries manually into a folder, and specify those things
# manually
